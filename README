MuFLR-HDM version 1.0
================================================================================

Installation:

MuFLR-HDM relies on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), available at 
https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ .  Once this has been installed, edit the 
PATHS variable in Makefile to include the locations of the GSL headers and 
libraries.  Then compile MuFLR-HDM using 'make' from the command prompt.

Parallelization in MuFLR-HDM uses OpenMP.  The code may be compiled without 
parallelization by deleting the "-fopenmp" flag in the Makefile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running:

MuFLR-HDM is run directly from the command prompt.  It requires:

  1.  a file params_MuFLR-HDM.dat listing the cosmological parameters and 
      code inputs, as detailed in the comments to the sample 
      params_MuFLR-HDM.dat file included, and passed as an argument; 

  2.  a transfer function at redshift 0, in the standard 7-column CAMB format 
      (https://camb.info): k[h/Mpc], delta_c, delta_b, delta_gamma, 
      delta_nu(massless), delta_nu(massive), delta_m (alternatively, the 
      7-column file produced by CLASS with format=camb, or the first 7 columns
      of the 13-column transfer functions produced by newer CAMB versions), 
      and named as specified in params_MuFLR-HDM.dat ; 

  3.  an HDM distribution function file with two columns, p/T and f(p), 
      named as specified in params_MuFLR-HDM.dat and with the normalization
      used by the CLASS code (for example, Fermi-Dirac at low momentum
      approaches 1/2/(2*pi)^3 rather than 1/2 for a single particle, and twice
      that for a particle-antiparticle pair).

A sample params_MuFLR-HDM.dat and the corresponding CAMB transfer function file
and Fermi-Dirac distribution function file are included with the code.  Also 
included are the shell scripts run, which executes class and MuFLR-HDM, and 
process_ICs.bash, which processes the result into the CDM+baryon power spectrum 
and growth rate at each time step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Printing results:

MuFLR-HDM outputs are governed by the third code switch in params_MuFLR-HDM.dat,
labelled "print results" in the example parameters file.  Values 0-3, 
respectively, refer to the functions print_all_growth, 
print_all_Pcblin_Pcbnl_Pnutot, print_all_Pmono, and print_all_perturbations in 
MuFLR-HDM.c.  At each output redshift and each wave number:

  0.  print_all_growth prints the CDM+baryon growth factor D, its logarithic
      derivative f = dln(D)/dln(a), and the total neutrino density monopole;

  1.  print_all_Pcblin_Pcbnl_Pnutot prints the linear CDM+baryon power, the 
      non-linear CDM+baryon power, and the total neutrino monopole power;

  2.  print_all_Pmono prints linear CDM+baryon power, the non-linear CDM+baryon 
      power, and the neutrino power for each fluid individually;

  3.  print_all_perturbations prints all neutrino density and velocity 
      divergence Legendre moments, followed by the linear and non-linear 
      CDM+baryon density and velocity divergence as well as the Time-RG 
      bispectrum integrals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuning performance and outputs:

Default code performance parameters have been chosen for a combination of speed
and accuracy.  The non-negative tolerance parameters PARAM_DETA0, PARAM_EABS, 
and PARAM_EREL in MuFLR-HDM.c may be reduced for greater accuracy.  These three
are, respectively, the starting step size in ln(a), the absolute tolerance, and
the relative tolerance.  After changing these parameters, MuFLR-HDM must be 
recompiled.
